# Weather Data Collector

This Python script collects weather data for multiple cities using the OpenWeatherMap API and stores it in a DataFrame. Users can input the city name and select which weather data parameters they want to include in the DataFrame.

## Codes Overview

### First Code
- The first code collects basic weather data (city name, country, temperature min/max, pressure, humidity) for a single city.
- Users input the city name, and the script retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- The retrieved data is processed and stored in a DataFrame.

### Second Code
- The second code extends the functionality by allowing users to select which weather data parameters they want to include in the DataFrame.
- Users input the city name and select from a list of available weather data parameters.
- The selected parameters are fetched from the API and stored in the DataFrame.
